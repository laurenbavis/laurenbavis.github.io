<p><a href="https://sickpodcast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sick</a> is a serial investigative podcast about what goes wrong in the places meant to keep us healthy. The <a href="https://sickpodcast.org/season2" title="https://sickpodcast.org/season2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second season</a>, released in fall 2021, investigated prisons – places that have to keep people healthy, but are built to punish them. The first season, released in fall 2019, was an investigation into fertility medicine and an Indiana doctor who used his own sperm to secretly impregnate his patients in the 1970s and 1980s. The podcast earned a regional Edward R. Murrow award, first place in its division from the Public Media Journalists Association, and first place in the podcast category from the Indiana chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.
